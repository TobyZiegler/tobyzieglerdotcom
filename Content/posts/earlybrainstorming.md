# What to do with all this?


### First, a list of the things I love.


These are possibilities for inclusion, or basing the entire thing on. No judgements.

I love:

- Tracye
- Aidan
- Family
- Things I miss
- Computers
- Macs
- Programming/Coding
- Applescript
- Graphics
- Friends
- Travel
- Tropical Places
- Beaches
- Landscapes
- Food!
- Reading
- Science Fiction
- Movies
- Naps
- Luxury
- Snuggles
- Cuddles
- Hugs


### Stormed. Now what?


That's a very good question.

Somehow, this needs to inspire a theme, or perhaps sections of the site.
