# What to do with all this?


### First, a list of the things I love.


These are possibilities for inclusion, or basing the entire thing on. No judgements.

I love:

- Tracye
- Aidan
- Family
- Things I miss
- Computers
- Macs
- Programming/Coding
- Applescript
- Graphics
- Friends
- Travel
- Tropical Places
- Beaches
- Landscapes
- Food!
- Reading
- Science Fiction
- Movies
- Naps
- Luxury
- Snuggles
- Cuddles
- Hugs
- Writing
- Storytelling


### Stormed. Now what?


That's a very good question.

Somehow, this needs to inspire a theme, or perhaps sections of the site. Let's see what we have here...

With Tracye, Aidan, Family and Friends, the site could be about the people I love. That would suggest photos and stories, perhaps? Maybe. Not sure I'm comfortable sharing such personal things with the world wide web at large.

Travel, Tropical Places and Beaches follow a theme. It might be worth examining the photos in stock from past vacations. With so few vacations and travel opportunities happening in the current realm, it might prove something of a dead end. Grrr. Arrgh.

Things I miss? Looking back a few days later, I'm not really sure what I was thinking there. I love things I miss doesn't quite jive. Skipping for now, and likely forever.

Computers! Specifically of the Macintosh variety. I'm not sure what I would do that isn't just a complete copycat of other things already done, but the passion is definitely there.

Programming. Since the site is an experiment in Swift to web pages, it might be cool to theme it around the code necessary to make it happen. Not bad. Could combine with the Mac passion. Maybe use an old finder theme? Has potential...

Applescript. Much more niche. Having a section of a Programming approach devoted to Applescript sounds doable.

Graphics. Dunno.

Food! The food faces immediately comes to mind. Maybe combined with that old auto-Facebook post idea from the deep, dark past.
