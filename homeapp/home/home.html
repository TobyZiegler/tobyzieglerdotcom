                    <p>Unfortunately, this is also a place with much in common with the cobbler's shoeless children; I
                        spend most of my time doing for someone else. There is precious little time left for this. Of
                        course, hindered is not stopped, so I persevere.</p>

                    <p>In the past I have spent a lot of time getting the mechanics just right. Since there is only so
                        much time to go around, the content often suffered. So while the mechanics are fascinating and
                        I love figuring out the latest greatest whatever, I am striving for a better balance and the
                        most efficient use of my time.</p>

                    <p>This section is mostly for the geeky among us. If you don't care about how web pages are built,
                        this is definitely a skippable section.</p>
                    <p>The latest renovation to this home has produced a place which is both a single- and multi-page
                        app.</p>
                    <p>This has the neat effect of putting all the main elements on one page, shown one after the
                        other, but showing each separately when selected from the menu. Thus, selecting the resume
                        brings up a page with just the navbar, footer and resume.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="w3-col l3 m6">
                    <p>These segments are built primarily with a mix of AngularJS and w3.CSS frameworks. The last
                        version was built primarily using the Bootstrap and jQuery frameworks. The version before that
                        was almost entirely PHP driven, with custom JavaScripts.</p>
                    <p>I always want to do things in the most optimal way, so part of my personal challenge is
                        balancing when to pull the trigger on a new version. It is a balancing act of time on hand,
                        time invested and return for the effort.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="w3-col l3 m6">
                    <p>Once upon a time, I carefully hand-crafted every line of code. No dependencies. Everything from
                        scratch. Often inspired by others, but always worked out and implemented by me, myself and I.</p>
                    <p>I can be silly sometimes.</p>
                    <p>There are trade-offs to using the latest fancy buzz-word flavors. CSS frameworks like Bootstrap
                        and w3.CSS have major advantages in the speed of developing pages, for example, but clutter up
                        the html with strings of classes not normally encountered in custom CSS. The purist in me
                        objects, while my practical side says something like, "No problem!".</p>
